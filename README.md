	Generalized Fine-Grained Category Discovery with Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts<br>
</p>

![framework](assets/framework.png)
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2) Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results, particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Environment Setup

1. Create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gcd-env
```

2. Configure data paths:
```bash
# Modify the data directory paths in config.py
vim config.py
```

### Training Pipeline

For each dataset, follow these two steps:

1. **Get KNN param:**
```bash
bash scripts_knn/[dataset_name].sh
```

2. **Train the model:**
```bash
bash scripts/train_[dataset_name].sh
```

Replace `[dataset_name]` with one of: `cub`, `scars`, `animalia`, `fungi`, `mollusca`, `actinopterygii`, `herbarium19`, `nabirds`, `reptilia`.
